# Architecture Guidelines for Discord Library Project
## Introduction

This document outlines the architecture and guidelines for the Discord library project, which aims to handle thousands
of requests efficiently across multiple platforms. The project leverages both Java and Kotlin, adhering to Domain-Driven
Design (DDD) principles and best practices for JVM multi-language projects.

Project Structure
The project is organized into multiple modules, each responsible for a specific part of the application. The modules
include:

Domain Layer
Application Layer
Infrastructure Layer
Shared Module

Directory Structure
Each module will have its own directory with the following structure:
```markdown
module-name/
├── src/
│ ├── main/
│ │ ├── java/
│ │ └── kotlin/
│ └── test/
│ ├── java/
│ └── kotlin/
└── ArchitectureGuideline.md
```


Module Breakdown

Domain Layer

Responsibilities: Core business logic, entities, value objects, and aggregates.

Implementation: Java

Packages: dev.amirgol.domain.user, com.discord.domain.guild, etc.

Application Layer

Location: application/

Responsibilities: Orchestration of use cases.

Implementation: Kotlin

Packages: dev.amirgol.application.service, com.discord.application.usecase, etc.

Infrastructure Layer

Location: infrastructure/

Responsibilities: External interactions like networking, data persistence, and caching.

Implementation: Java and Kotlin based on library requirements.

Packages: dev.amirgol.infrastructure.client, com.discord.infrastructure.repository, etc.

Shared Module

Location: shared/

Responsibilities: Utilities, configurations, and common components.

Implementation: Java and Kotlin

Packages: dev.amirgol.shared.utils, com.discord.shared.config, etc.

Dependency Management
Domain Layer: No dependencies on other layers.

Application Layer: Depends on Domain Layer.

Infrastructure Layer: Depends on Domain Layer and Application Layer as needed.

Shared Module: Minimal dependencies; used across modules.

Package Naming Conventions
Use reverse domain name notation (e.g.,dev.amirgol.module-name.package-name).

Ensure consistency across modules.

Language Choice Rationale
Java: Used for the Domain Layer due to its maturity and performance benefits.

Kotlin: Used for the Application Layer to leverage its expressive features and concise syntax.

Shared Module: Contains both Java and Kotlin code for common utilities and configurations.

Guidelines for Contributors
Domain Layer:

Focus on business logic.

Avoid external dependencies.

Application Layer:

Orchestrate use cases.

Use Kotlin's features for concise code.

Infrastructure Layer:

Handle external interactions.

Use Java or Kotlin based on library requirements.

Shared Module:

Develop utilities and configurations.

Ensure code is reusable across modules.

Testing
Unit Tests: Located in src/test/java and src/test/kotlin.

Integration Tests: Encapsulate cross-module interactions.

Performance Tests: Ensure the library handles thousands of requests efficiently.

Documentation
ArchitectureGuideline.md: Present in each module for specific guidelines.

Code Documentation: Use JavaDoc and KotlinDoc for clear API documentation.

Conclusion
This architecture ensures a clear separation of concerns, efficient handling of requests, and scalability. By following
these guidelines, the project will maintain high quality.
